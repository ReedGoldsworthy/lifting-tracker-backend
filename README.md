<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![p1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda599db-97a7-4d00-b6e1-cba9d9b9e404)

**Spotify-Util** is a full-stack web application designed to enhance your Spotify experience by providing advanced playlist management and analysis features. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React, this application leverages Spotify's OAuth2 for authentication and API access.

### Key Features

- **Spotify OAuth2 Integration**: Securely sign in with Spotify and manage your access tokens and playlists.
- **Track List Management**: View and sort your playlists in a tabular format, filter tracks by various attributes, and stage songs for further use.
- **Data Visualization**: Gain insights into your playlists with visualizations including genre breakdowns, top artists, release year graphs, and detailed attribute displays such as Danceability, Energy, and Popularity.
- **Playlist Creation**: Use the staged songs to create new playlists directly on Spotify, streamlining your music organization process.

### Purpose

Spotify-Util was developed to provide a more robust tool for analyzing, organizing, and creating playlists. By extending the capabilities of Spotify's built-in features, the application aims to give users a deeper understanding of their music and more control over their playlist creation.
